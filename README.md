# SmartClimate: Sensor-Based Climate Data Analysis for Smart Cities

## 📌 Project Overview
SmartClimate is a climate data analysis project designed for a smart city initiative. The objective is to process over 10 years of temperature sensor data to uncover meaningful climate patterns, detect anomalies, and prepare the data for integration into machine learning models.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
A European smart city needed to:
- Analyze massive volumes of time-series sensor data.
- Calculate daily, monthly, and yearly climate trends.
- Identify anomalies in environmental readings.
- Integrate processed data with ML models for predictive insights.

## ✅ Solution Overview
*Technologies Used:*
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

*Steps:*
1. *Data Loading:* Imported CSV using NumPy for performance.
2. *Data Aggregation:*
   - Daily averages (row-wise)
   - Monthly averages (sensor-wise)
3. *Outlier Detection:*
   - Statistical method: 2σ (standard deviation rule)
   - ML method: Isolation Forest
4. *Optimization:* Vectorized NumPy operations reduced runtime drastically.
5. *Visualization:* Plotted trends and outliers using matplotlib and seaborn.
6. *ML Integration:* Cleaned data passed into IsolationForest for anomaly prediction.
